# Text Analysis Project - Love and Fear Word Counts

## Overview
This assignment involves analyzing twelve novels by Jane Austen and Wilkie Collins to create a scatter plot based on the counts of "love" and "fear" words in each book. The x-axis represents the fraction of times "love" words are mentioned relative to the total length of each book, while the y-axis represents the fraction of times "fear" words are mentioned.

## Files
In the "Files" section, you will find a folder named "Text-module3." This folder contains the following files:

- **Jane_Austen_Novels (6 books)**
- **Wilkie_Collins_Novels (6 books)**
- **stopwords.txt** (a list of words to be ignored)
- **roget_thesaurus_1911_love_words.txt** (word list from a 1911 Roget thesaurus for love)
- **roget_thesaurus_1911_fear_words.txt** (word list from a 1911 Roget thesaurus for fear)

## Assignment Details
Your task is to generate a scatter plot with 12 dots, each corresponding to one of the novels. The x-axis of the plot should represent the fraction of times "love" words are mentioned, and the y-axis should represent the fraction of times "fear" words are mentioned. These fractions should be calculated relative to the total length of each respective book.

## Important Note
When analyzing the novels, consider the provided word lists and ignore the stopwords. Additionally, keep in mind the context of the 19th century language usage, as explained in the assignment description.

## Data Source
If the files are not uploaded, you can retrieve the novels from Project Gutenberg. However, the provided files save you from the tedious task of extracting the relevant text and removing additional content, such as copyright discussions, from Gutenberg's text.
